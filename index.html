                An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
            </h3>
            <p>
                “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror. Some may
                be simple black
                cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror”
                but have
                elements or threads of horror.

                    Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon Durham. Most film clips
                    contain
                    major spoilers,
                    and it is recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            <p>This film came as a total surprise. After falling down the “Viewers Also Watched” rabbit hole on Apple TV
                one night, I
                found it probably 20 levels deep. It’s since become more popular, but at the time had no marketing or
                exposure. I went
                in not expecting much at all, but instead didn’t just like the film, I loved it. It’s thoroughly
                enjoyable, and
                genuinely creepy with several truly unnerving scenes. A fresh take on the genre, and follows no
                well-worn path.

                Note: If you can (as a general rule, of course), see if you can find the non-dubbed version of the film.
                Also: There is
                nothing creepier than a dead kid, and this film features possibly the creepiest of them all.
